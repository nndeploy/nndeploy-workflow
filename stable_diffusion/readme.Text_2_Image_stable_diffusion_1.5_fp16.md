## Environment Requirements

This algorithm requires the ONNXRuntime-CUDA version as the inference backend for optimal performance. Since the default Python package includes the ONNXRuntime-CPU version, you need to:

1. Switch to developer mode
2. Refer to the [Developer Documentation](https://nndeploy-zh.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/quick_start/build.html) for configuration

**Note**: Ensure that your system has CUDA environment installed to support GPU-accelerated inference.
